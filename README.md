# aria spec data
Inspired by .json files available for HTML spec, creating some data files for aria spec (https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/). 

The purpose of these files is to make it easier for JS engineers to consume information about accessibility & ease the responsibility of making acessible web-based products.
